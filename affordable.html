            <h3>HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD)</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, the maximum storage capacity of a hard disk drive is 22TB. Nevertheless, the actual available space on an HDD is reduced due to the allocation of space by the operating system, file system structures, and data redundancy procedures.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="speedli"><p>16GB,32GB, and 64GB are the lowest capacity HDD available and are typically found in an older and smaller device.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>The range of 120GB to 256GB is generally considered an entry point for HDD devices commonly used in laptops or computers.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>500GB,1TB, and 2TB are popular HDD storage users, around 500GB or more of storage is typically considered sufficient. This space should suffice for storing music, photos, videos, and other files. Those with large game collections may want to consider 1TB or 2TB of storage.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>A hard disk drive(HDD) with a capacity of over 2 terabytes is recommended for users who work with high-resolution files, need to store or house a large amount of data or require a backup and redundancy.</p></li>

            <h3>SOLID-STATE DRIVE (SSD)</h3>
            <p>Various terms are employed to refer to different types of SSD, for instance, mSATA or PCle. To link an SSD to your system or motherboard, you need to attach it through a specified type of connection interface. Hereâ€™s a rundown of what you need to know about the most common SSD interface.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="speedli"><p>PCle and NVMe SSD: The standard interface for PCle is generally used to link high-performance hardware including graphics and network cards to your computer, leading to a high bandwidth and low latency connection that is remarkably fast. For situations where you require incredibly swift communication between your SSD and CPU/RAM, PCle is the perfect choice. SSD that adopts the PCle connection type rely on the Non-volatile Memory Express standard (NVMe) and provide up to 32 Gbps of raw throughput, functioning at speeds as high as 7 Gbps.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>mSATA III, and traditional SSD: Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is an older interface for solid-state drives, designed for storage, NVMe is not the preferred alternative, offering significantly greater speed. Nonetheless, an upgrade to a SATA-based SSD can still benefit older Pcs and laptops with HDD.</p></li>

            <h3>HARD DISK DRIVE (HDD)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="speedli"><p>Lower Initial Cost: Many people have noticed that HDDs are typically less expensive per gigabyte of storage. Because of this, they are a desirable option for people with little funds or who want a lot of storage.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>Value for Mass Storage: Users who need a lot of storage space for tasks like media file archiving or backups frequently discover HDDs to be more affordable.</p></li>

            <h3>SOLID-STATE DRIVE (SSD)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="speedli"><p>Total Cost of Ownership: According to some reviewers, SSDs can be more affordable in the long term since they use less power, which can result in reduced electricity bills, and they are more durable, which means fewer replacements will be necessary.</p></li>
                <li class="speedli"><p>Laptop Upgrade: People who upgrade laptops frequently discover that switching from an HDD to an SSD result in a substantial performance gain and is therefore a financially sound upgrade.</p></li>

    <div class="stacked-layout">
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>In summary, the price difference between HDDs and SSDs can be attributed to differences in technology scale and availability of raw material costs, and market demand. HDDs use older and less expensive technology have been produced in large volumes for decades and use cheaper materials compared to SSDs. On the other hand, SSDs offer superior performance and durability. While they may be more expensive the benefits, they provide can justify the higher price for many users. Ultimately the choice between an HDD and an SSD depends on your specific needs and budget.</p>
