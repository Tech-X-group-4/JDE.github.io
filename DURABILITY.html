        <h2>WHICH IS MORE DURABLE?</h2>
        <h3>LIFESPAN OF SSD AND HDD</h3>
        <p>The lifespan of an SSD is significantly longer than that of an HDD. While HDDs tend to last around 3-5 years, SSDs can last up to 10 years or more. This is because SSDs have no moving parts, whereas HDDs have spinning disks that can wear down over time. Additionally, SSDs don't require defragmentation like HDDs do, which also helps to extend their lifespan. So if you're looking for a computer storage solution that will last for a long time, an SSD is the way to go.</p>
