            <h3>WHAT IS HARD DISK DRIVES (HDD)?</h3>
            <p>The hard disk drive (HDD) in a computer is a non-volatile data storage device that keeps data even when powered off. One sort of storage device that is frequently installed in desktop computers, mobile devices, consumer electronics, and enterprise storage arrays in data centres is the HDD. They can use magnetic disks to store operating systems, software programs, and other files. Hard disk drives, more particularly, govern the reading and writing of the hard disk that stores data. In a computer, HDDs are either utilized as the primary storage device or the backup storage device. They are typically located in drive bays and are connected to the motherboard through an Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA), Serial ATA, parallel ATA, or Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) cable, among other formats. Even when powered down, the HDD can retain stored data because it is also attached to a power supply device.</p>

        <h3>HOW DOES HARD DISK DRIVES (HDD) WORKS?</h3>
        <p>Most fundamental hard drives are made up of several disk platters, which are circular disks composed of aluminium, glass, or ceramic and arranged around a spindle inside a hermetically sealed chamber. A motor attached to the spindle rotates the platter. The chamber also houses the read/write heads, which use a magnetic head to record information magnetically to and from tracks on platters. Additionally, the disks feature a thin magnetic covering. Up to 15,000 rotations per minute are made by the motor as it spins the platters. A second motor regulates the position of the read and write heads, which magnetically store and read data on each platter, while the platters spin.</p>

        <h3>ABOUT MOVING PART IN HDD</h3>
        <p>The actuator arm, read/write heads, and spindle motor are mechanical components that are essential for the HDD's mechanical operation:</p>
        <ul class="speedul">
            <li><p>ACTUATOR ARM: Places the read-write heads so they can navigate across the rotating platters and access various data locations.</p></li>
            <li><p>READ/WRITE HEAD: Move while hovering just above the platters to read and write data.</p></li>
            <li><p>SPINDLE MOTOR: Keeps the platters turning at the same speed.</p></li>
        </ul>

            <h3>WHAT IS SOLID-STATE DRIVE (SSD)?</h3>
            <p>SSDs, often known as solid-state drives, are a form of storage hardware found in computers. Persistent information is stored on solid-state flash memory in this non-volatile storage medium. SSDs take the role of conventional hard disk drives (HDDs) in computers and carry out all of a hard drive's fundamental duties. SSDs, however, are much speedier in comparison. The operating system of the device will boot up more quickly, programs will load more swiftly, and files can be saved more quickly with an SSD. Wherever hard disks are being utilized, SSDs can be used as well. They have graphics cards built into them as well. However, they are more costly than traditional HDDs. The creation and use of SSDs have been driven by businesses with a fast-growing demand for increased input/output (I/O). SSDs can effectively manage both intensive read and random workloads because of their decreased latency compared to HDDs. Because a flash SSD can read data directly and instantly from stored data, it has lower latency. Any application that must send information in real-time, whether it be on high-performance servers, laptops, desktops, or other devices, can profit from solid-state drive technology. Due to these features, corporate SSDs are suited for offloading reads from transaction-heavy databases. With the use of virtual desktop architecture or by using a hybrid cloud to store frequently used data locally inside a storage array, they can also assist in reducing boot storms.</p>

        <h3>HOW DOES SOLID-STATE DRIVES (SSD) WORKS?</h3>
        <p>An SSD reads and writes data to silicon flash memory chips that are interconnected beneath the surface. To achieve various densities, manufacturers stack chips in a grid to create SSDs. SSDs access an underlying network of linked flash memory chips to read and write data. These chips enable the SSD to store data even when it is not connected to a power source by using floating gate transistors (FGTs) to hold an electrical charge. A single bit of data denoted either as a 1 for a charged cell or a 0 for a cell with no electrical charge, is included in each FGT. There is constant access to every piece of data. SSDs, however, are limited to writing only empty blocks. Additionally, performance may deteriorate over time even with SSDs' methods for avoiding this. Single-, multi- and triple-level cells make up the three primary memory types used in SSDs. Data bits of type one or zero can be stored in single-level cells. The fastest and most reliable SSDs are single-level cells (SLCs), which are also the costliest. In the same amount of physical space as an SLC, multi-level cells (MLCs) can store more data and can accommodate two bits of data per cell. MLC write rates, however, are slower. Three bits of data can be stored in a cell using triple-level cells (TLCs). TLCs are less expensive than other memory types, but they also have slower write rates and a shorter lifespan. TLC-based SSDs provide more flash storage and cost less than MLC or SLC models, but because each TLC cell has eight states, bit rot is more likely to occur.</p>

        <h3>WHAT IS MICROSHIP?</h3>
        <p>A microchip is a collection of electronic circuits on a tiny flat piece of silicon, also known as a chip, computer chip, integrated circuit, or IC. Transistors function as miniature electrical switches on the chip that can turn a current on or off. A multilayered latticework of connected forms is formed on the silicon wafer to create the pattern of microscopic switches.</p>
