        <h2>WHICH IS FASTER</h2>
        <p> The Seagate Exos currently holds the title for the fastest HDD available which offers 524MB/second speeds. The drive spins 7200 revolutions per minute (RPM), which represents the maximum speed a physical; entity can maintain. Faster speeds are restricted by the physical limitations of the platters, but HDDs still have their valuable purpose and advantages. On the other hand, SSD is not limited by the spinning platters. Hence, the SSD offers over 7000MB/second transfer speeds. With a speed over 14 times faster, it offers a significant advantage and speed difference for computers. However, an SSD still has its disadvantages over an HDD, this depends on your application. Overall, SSD work faster than HDD.</p>

            <h3>DOES THE SSD READ FASTER THAN THE HDD?</h3>
            <p>Nonetheless, HDDs are designed to either write and store data quickly or perform read-and-write functions like those installed in a desktop computer. SSDs are not usually preferred for long-term backups but are used for applications that require high-speed performance. A standard HDD can read and write at a speed of approximately 80MB/second to 160MB/second, whereas an SSD can read and write at between 200MB/second to 550MB/second. Modern technology advancements offer faster speeds but at a considerably higher price than regular storage drives.</p>

            <h3>DOES THE SSD WRITE FASTER THAN THE HDD?</h3>
            <p>An SSD is flash memory, which allows for faster data writing than an HDD. It is worth noting that an SSD experiences degradation when it undergoes the read-erase-write process. This process of overwriting data is more likely to occur as the SSD fills up, so it is generally considered good practice to leave plenty of free space on the SSD. Additionally, HDD can currently store more data as well as be suitable for long-term storage with fewer reads, such as disaster recovery and backup storage pools.</p>
