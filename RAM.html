        <h2>HOW MUCH DOES RAM AFFECT HDD AND SSD?</h2>
        <p>To test this, we conducted an experiment using a laptop with an HDD and SSD and took the average result from it, here are the results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stacked-layout">
        <h3>HDD (WD Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM)</h3>

    <div class="stacked-layout">
        <p>The one on the left is with 16GBs of RAM and the one on the right is with 8GBs of RAM. The speed has some drops and increases, but not significant which is 100+ MB/s worth of difference. The amount of RAM doesn’t affect the speed if it’s over the minimum amount, which is for SSD is usually 4GBs and for HDD it is usually 2GBs since SSD and/or HDD and RAM are 2 different devices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stacked-layout">
        <h3>DOES RAM AFFECT HDD AND SSD?</h3>
        <p>Yes and no, while they are both considered storage devices and store data and programs, RAM is used to store computer programs and data that the CPU needs in real-time and RAM data is volatile and is erased once the computer is switched off. HDD and SSD is a permanent storage device that stores data permanently even after the computer is turned off and it is used to store user-specific data and operating files. However, if your device has lower than the minimum amount of RAM needed, then you’ll start seeing problems with your read and write speed because while they are 2 separate devices, HDD and SSD still need their minimum requirement of RAM to function properly since RAM acts as a buffer between the 2 drives. The transferring of data usually goes to the RAM first and then to the HDD and/or SSD.</p>
